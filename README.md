## About Charlie
Charlie is a cute cat who has **mostly munchkin and some Scottish fold** in him. He is really fluffy because his **relatives are ragdolls**.  Somehow he is really chill, and when I got him (Christmas eve) I found him in a treasure chest. Apparently she put Charlie in the treasure chest while we were not looking and had us open the chest. My mom said the look on my face was *priceless*.
